# Using-Artifical-Intelligence-to-Detect-Distracted-Driving

This project was made for TKS AI Hackathon in October 2020. Our goal was to identify a problem that can be solved using Artifical Intelligence. The problem that our team has 
come up with is the problem of distrcated driving. More than 50 million people are caught up in car accidents every year. What if there was a way we could prevent it?
Self driving cars aren't feasiable; they can't be implemented **right now**. We need to find a way to implement a method to detect distracted driving in our cars.

# How we use AI to Detect Distracted Driving

Our team developed a Convolutional Neural Network that's trained on the [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data).__
The 10 classes in this dataset include:

1. c0: safe driving
2. c1: texting - right
3. c2: talking on the phone - right
4. c3: texting - left
5. c4: talking on the phone - left
6. c5: operating the radio
7. c6: drinking
8. c7: reaching behind
9. c8: hair and makeup
10. c9: talking to passenger
