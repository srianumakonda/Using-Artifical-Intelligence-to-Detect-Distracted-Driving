# Using-Artifical-Intelligence-to-Detect-Distracted-Driving

This project was made for TKS AI Hackathon in October 2020. Our goal was to identify a problem that can be solved using Artifical Intelligence. The problem that our team has 
come up with is the problem of distrcated driving. More than 50 million people are caught up in car accidents every year. What if there was a way we could prevent it?
Self driving cars aren't feasiable; they can't be implemented <b>right now</b>
